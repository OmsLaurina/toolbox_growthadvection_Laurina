Growth-advection model by Messi√© & Chavez (2017), adapted to the Mediterranean by Kientz (2022). In work by me to improve the adaptation to the Mediterranean sea. Main changes are on nutrients and uptake. This adapted model is forced by phosphate instead nitrate and all phytoplankton types can use new and regenerated productions. So there is just one compartiment for phosphate. Moreover to simplify we implement only one zooplankton compartiment. 

Here you can found the last versions of the model (growth_model_*_v*.m). To run them in one dimension (only time) use the utils folder.
